AI enabled Marketing Tool

Qt C++ based frontend for an email / sms marketing tool, with the option to generate content through AI on a per email/sms basis. It will eventually be cross-platform ( Desktop/Mobile/Web ) and the back-end will be implemented in Java Spring.

This is the initial commit and only contains Qt UI and C++ files necessary to show off some screens. Even the variable names are not properly maintained, and shall be taken care of very soon.

You may clone the entire repo and open the Qt project to check out the screens and code using Qt Creator if you wish. I am currently using Qt Framework 6.7.1 and Qt Creator 13.0.1

If you wish to contribute to this project, you are most welcome.
